# Shopify-Data Science-Intern-Challenge-2022

* Question 1  
Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: click here to access the required data set
On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. What metric would you report for this dataset? What is its value?

* Solution:  
No of orders: 5000  
Total Value of Orders: $ 15725640  
Total No of Items sold: 43936  

Curently AOV is caluculated as   AOV = Total Value of Orders divide by No of Orders  
                                     = 15725640 / 5000  
                                     = $ 3145.13  
                                     
As the quantity per order can be more then one so the correct way to calculate AOV will be  
                                                                                         = total Value of Orders / Total no. of Items  
                                                                                         = 15725640 / 43936 = $357.92  
which looks resonable.

These records shown above are the outliners, 19 items are sold at total price of $ 488775 at an average price of 488775/ 19 = 25725 which looks outlandish and all are sold from SHOP_ID of 78


* Question 2  
For this question youâ€™ll need to use SQL. Follow this link to access the data set required for the challenge. Please use queries to answer the following questions. Paste your queries along with your final numerical answers below.

* a) How many orders were shipped by Speedy Express in total?  
select count(*) from Shippers a ,Orders  b where Shippername = 'Speedy Express' and a.ShipperID = b.ShipperID;

* b)What is the last name of the employee with the most orders?  
select b.Lastname,count(a.EmployeeId) from Orders a,Employees b  
where a.EmployeeId=b.EmployeeId group by b.EmployeeId,b.Lastname  
ORDER BY count(a.EmployeeId) DESC  
LIMIT 1;

* c)What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?  
select b.ProductID, b.ProductName,sum(a.Quantity) as orderqty from OrderDetails a,Products b, Customers c, Orders d  
where a.ProductID=b.ProductID and d.OrderID = a.OrderID and d.CustomerID=c.CustomerID  
and c.Country='Germany'  
group by b.ProductId,b.Productname   
ORDER BY orderqty DESC  
LIMIT 1;
